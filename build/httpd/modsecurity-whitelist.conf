# Whitelist for ModSecurity.
#
# This file defines the rules that are disabled for
# specific URLs because we know they are valid. It
# is versioned in git :
# https://github.com/epfl-idevelop/jahia2wp/blob/master/build/httpd/modsecurity-whitelist.conf
#
# To see how to edit this file you can look at the cookbook:
# https://confluence.epfl.ch:8443/display/SIAC/ModSecurity+Cookbook
#
# To know more about a rule you can look at the configuration files in:
# /usr/share/modsecurity-crs/rules
#
# The configuration files are grouped by request and response rules.
# So for example, rule 941100 is defined in:
# /usr/share/modsecurity-crs/rules/REQUEST-941-APPLICATION-ATTACK-XSS.conf
#
# By the name of the configuration file alone you know that it's related
# to requests with XSS attacks.
