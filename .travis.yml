# We have to clone this repository because Travis will always try to build images defined by "build" entry in
# "docker-compose.yml", even if we told him to not do it. Because we have to keep "build" entries in "docker-compose.yml"
# file, we have to clone this repo before doing "make up". Furthermore, building images will help to check if everything
# is ok in images files.

# On searching containers by labels, see

# The labels introduced by docker-compose don't seem to be documented
# anywhere, but you can list them with "docker inspect". The closest
# we have to something official would be this pull request's comment:
# https://github.com/docker/compose/pull/1356#issuecomment-99801372
