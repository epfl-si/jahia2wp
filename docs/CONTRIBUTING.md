# Contributing to Jahia2wp

As an open source project, we always welcome contributions of many forms.

Examples of contributions include:

1. Submitting issues for any feature enhancements, bugs or documentation problems.
1. Fixing open issues by sending PRs
1. Adding documentation

**Warning**: In order to ease the process, and set expectations, be sure to submit a PR after discussing it in an issue. Non-trivial pull requests (anything more than fixing a typo) without issues will be closed!

When discussing changes and issues, please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

As you have surely seen before reaching this page, most of the project is written in python. Hence a few practices that should guide you:

1. code should respect [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) conventions
1. new code should come with automatic tests
1. all tests (new and existing) should pass
1. coverage should not decrease (codcov will automatically comment the PRs with a coverage report)
1. high level documentation should be written in [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
