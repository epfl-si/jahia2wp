# file: roles/wordpress/defaults/main.yml
#
# The variables that the role relies on, and that the user is supposed
# to pass either
#
# - through per-host variables (in hosts/wordpress-instances),
#
# - through per-group variables (in hosts/group_vars/*),
#
# - or on the command line using -e / --extra-vars.
#
# (unless of course there is a default value defined below - That's
# what the "defaults" part of defaults/main.yml is for)

########################################################################
# Host variables
########################################################################
# - wp_env: The name of the top-level directory (under the /srv of the
#            Openshift instance) where the server root resides
#
# - wp_hostname: The HTTP host name (fully qualified domain name) this
#                  WordPress is served under
#
# - wp_path: The path relative to the htdocs directory where the WordPress
#            instance is installed

wp_path: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"

#
# - wp_unit_name: The unit name (used by jahia2wp.py generate); defaults
#                 to being equal to wp_unit_id

wp_unit_name: "{{ wp_unit_id }}"   # Default value

#
# - wp_unit_id: The unit ID (used by jahia2wp.py generate)
#

# Variables from the command line
########################################################################
#
#
# - wp_destructive: A map from WordPress names (out of the inventory
#                   files or scripts) to a keyword among "none" (the
#                   default), "config", "wipe", "data-and-code" or
#                   "data-only" indicating the level of destructive
#                   access requested for this WordPress instance.
#                   "wipe" means to completely and unconditionally
#                   delete everything; "data-and-code" and "data-only"
#                   allows restores (depending on the setting of
#                   wp_restore_from, below) of the corresponding
#                   assets. "config" means only enforce simple
#                   configuration changes, such as setting up strict
#                   permissions and disabling unused services. "none"
#                   means do no harm, yet doesn't preclude
#                   always-harmless mutations such as creating a WP
#                   site that did not yet exist.
#
#                   ðŸ’¡ You probably want to use the JSON-accepting
#                   form of -e for this. Be sure to use double quotes
#                   â€” Single quotes are *not* valid to escape JSON
#                   strings. Here is a correct example in bash:
#
#                      -e '{"wp_destructive": {"some-hapless-wordpress": "wipe"}}'

wp_destructive: {}   # Default value

#
# - wp_restore_from: One of "generate" (the default), "backup-prod",
#                      or "none" to skip the restore process
#                      altogether and leave the destroyed /
#                      nonexistent WordPresses in whatever state they
#                      are currently in.

wp_restore_from: 'generate'

# - dump_local_dir: The directory where ../tasks/dump.yml should
#                   dump the WXR (XML) files
