# Define variables that are used throughout this role.

# See ../defaults/main.yml for the variables the user is expected to
# provide (either through the inventory file, so-called "group_vars",
# or on the command line)
#
# See also the other files in this directory for variables that are
# only used by some of the tasks in this role. While this file,
# roles/wordpress/vars/main.yml is implicitly imported whenever the
# "wordpress" role is in play in a playbook, the other files in this
# directory need to be imported explicitly using the import_vars
# task.
