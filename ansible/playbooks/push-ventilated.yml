# This is an Ansible playbook to upload the ventilated WXR files into
# their new sites.
#
# ../src/ventilation/Makefile automatically creates the Ansible inventory
# and runs this script; you therefore don't want to run this playbook
# by hand.
#
# Expected directory layout in {{ from }}:
#
#  vpsi/
#    foo1.xml
#    foo2.xml
#
# All .xml files under vpsi/ will be undumped into the Wordpress called "vpsi"
# in the inventory, in no particular order.
